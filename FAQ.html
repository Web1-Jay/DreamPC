                    <p>We are a PC building company that allows everyone to have the PC to fit their needs, without needing to know all of the nooks and crannies of computers. We have PCs that are geared towards everyday life, gaming, and even the workplace. We even allow users to customize their PC as they please. Check out our gallery or begin shopping to get started!</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Our orders usually take around 1-2 weeks to arrive at the customers location. When you place your order, you will receive tracking information as soon as your PC is fully built and packaged. From there, you can track your package and its status as you please. But please be patient, as some parts for your PC may be on backorder. If that is case for your PC, we will always inform you.</p>

                    <p>Yes! If you happen to damage anything in your system physically, you can ship it back to us and we can repair it at our headquarters. There will be fees to repair, but it will always depend on what component is damaged. We will contact you with a quote as soon as you give us the details on your damage.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Incredibly safe! We package your PC in a special box with stabilizing foam and padding to ensure that your PC arrives with no damage of any kind. However, we are aware that shipping companies can make mistakes and cause your products to be damaged. In the event that your PC is damaged on arrival, please file a form to let us know what happened and include any pictures if possible (within 15 days of receiving your order). From there, you can send it back to us and we can possibly replace or ship you a whole new system free of charge.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>For all categories of computers, we rank them from one to three. Rank one being the weakest PC for that particular task and rank three being the strongest. All of our PCs can get the job done but we know how to spice up the experience for those who want some extra power!</p>

                    <p>There are no DreamPC stores, as we only operate through mail as of now. In the future we plan to open up in-person stores for the public to shop at. We will keep you up to date for when that happens!</p>
